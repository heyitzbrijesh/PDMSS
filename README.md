This code, based on NI LabVIEW, is for the rover of the PDMSS project whose circuit diagrams will also be uploaded soon.

# How to set up:

Prerequisites:
- Ready and set up LabVIEW 15+ environment. If you have a lower version, open an issue asking for your desired version, I will convert it.
- Rover Hardware

1. First, clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/shlokj/PDMSS`

2. Then open PDMS robot code.lvproj and double click on Main myRIO w_o sv control.vi.

3. Connect to the rover's WiFi.

4. Then run the code by clicking the single arrow towards the top left of the VI front panel.
Wait for a while and the code will start running on the myrio.
